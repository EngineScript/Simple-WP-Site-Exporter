## PHPMD Code Quality Analysis Failure

The automated PHP Mess Detector (PHPMD) analysis has detected code quality issues in the Simple WP Site Exporter plugin.

### Details

- **PHP Version:** {{ env.PHP_VERSION }}
- **WordPress Version:** Latest
- **Test Date:** {{ date | date('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss') }}
- **Workflow Run:** [View detailed logs]({{ env.WORKFLOW_URL }})

### Next Steps

This issue has been automatically created because the Simple WP Site Exporter plugin failed PHPMD code quality analysis. PHPMD detects:

#### Analyzed Areas:
1. **Clean Code**: Code complexity and maintainability issues
2. **Code Size**: Overly large classes, methods, or parameter lists
3. **Design**: Poor object-oriented design patterns
4. **Naming**: Inconsistent or unclear naming conventions
5. **Unused Code**: Dead code that should be removed

#### WordPress-Specific Configuration
This project uses a WordPress-specific PHPMD configuration (`phpmd.xml`) that suppresses WordPress-standard patterns:
- **Superglobals**: WordPress safely uses `$_GET`, `$_POST` with proper sanitization
- **Exit Expressions**: Required for file downloads and security redirects
- **Missing Imports**: WordPress core classes like `WP_Error` are auto-loaded
- **Else Expressions**: Sometimes required for WordPress security patterns

#### Common Issues:
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Methods with too many decision paths
- **NPath Complexity**: Methods with too many execution paths
- **Long Methods**: Methods that are too lengthy and should be split
- **Long Classes**: Classes that handle too many responsibilities
- **Too Many Parameters**: Methods with excessive parameter counts
- **Unused Variables**: Variables that are declared but never used
- **Superglobals**: Direct access to superglobal variables
- **CamelCase Violations**: Inconsistent naming conventions

#### Recommended Actions:

1. **Review Logs**: Check the workflow logs for specific PHPMD violations
2. **Local Analysis**: Run PHPMD locally to get detailed reports
3. **Refactor Code**: Break down complex methods and classes
4. **Remove Dead Code**: Eliminate unused variables and methods
5. **Improve Naming**: Use consistent and descriptive naming
6. **Validate**: Re-run PHPMD to confirm improvements

#### Local Testing Commands:
```bash
# Install dependencies
composer install

# Run PHPMD with WordPress-specific configuration (recommended)
./vendor/bin/phpmd simple-wp-site-exporter.php text phpmd.xml

# Run PHPMD with standard rules (may show WordPress-specific warnings)
./vendor/bin/phpmd simple-wp-site-exporter.php text cleancode,codesize,design,naming,unusedcode

# Generate HTML report with WordPress config
./vendor/bin/phpmd simple-wp-site-exporter.php html phpmd.xml --reportfile phpmd-report.html

# Check specific rules with high priority
./vendor/bin/phpmd simple-wp-site-exporter.php text codesize --minimumpriority 1
```

#### Example Fixes:
```php
// Before: High complexity
function complex_function($a, $b, $c, $d, $e) {
    if ($a) {
        if ($b) {
            if ($c) {
                // ...
            }
        }
    }
}

// After: Reduced complexity
function simple_function($data) {
    if (!$this->validate_data($data)) {
        return false;
    }
    return $this->process_data($data);
}
```

Once fixed, please close this issue and reference it in the changelog.
